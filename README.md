### **Project Description**

**Title:** Drug Safety Analysis and Recommendations

This project analyzes the safety and efficacy of various pharmaceutical drugs by examining their effects on cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and sodium-to-potassium (Na/K) ratios in a patient dataset. Utilizing statistical methods, including Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms, the study identifies key trends in drug usage, highlights the prevalence of high blood pressure and cholesterol, and provides targeted recommendations for healthcare interventions. Key findings emphasize the effectiveness of DrugY and the importance of tailored treatment plans based on patient demographics.
